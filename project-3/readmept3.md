## Project 3: CSS


<h1> Part 1: Literature Showcase Ideas </h1>
* I will create a site for a book
* The book that I chose is the autobiography called "Open" by Andre Agassi. The reason I chose this book is because (being a tennis player) it was interesting to hear about his journey to becoming one of the top tennis players in the world. But...the interesting part is he describes how he actually hated tennis.
* Here is are two excerpts:
> “Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players - and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement....”

 >"I play tennis for a living even though I hate tennis, hate it with a dark and secret passion and always have."

* I will probably write my own biography but use information from [here](https://www.biography.com/people/andre-agassi-9177078).
* I am thinking to use this color palette:

* For the font, I am planning on using Lora and Source Sans Pro

<h2> Topic-08: Typography


* Well I definitely had a hard time starting to use CSS. I was able to figure it out
using examples and A LOT OF testing/trial/error. The problem was I didn't have a
full grasp on HTML so incorporating CSS in addition was somewhat difficult. The
biggest problem I was struggling on was using external fonts through including and linking to external font-package files. So I ended up using the importing through the google fonts API method. I'm not sure if my CSS font style page is correct :/
...but the font seems to be working/showing up on my web page!
* I switched my color palette to match both the cover of the book and similar colors
to a tennis court.
* My readme is currently having issues as it seems text is overlapping in the readme view (The preview shows up ok). I keep getting error notifications...if anyone knows how to fix that?
* Overall I learned a ton of new material and both laughed and cried while doing it.

So I just uploaded my final work for what's due tonight (11/6/17) and the readme
is showing up incorrectly due to some error I can't figure out. So sorry for the terrible formatting. It's showing up normal in preview format.

<h2> Topic 09: Layout
<h3> Project Ideas </h3>
* Header: add logo tennis ball
* Navigation bar: add "learn more" link with wikipedia to Andre Agassi and/or the official Andre Agassi Website (as drop down menu)
* Main Content: Pull quote on sample and about pages


For my previous readme issue I just created a new readme file and formatting seems to be back to normal!
