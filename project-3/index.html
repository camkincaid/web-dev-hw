        <h2>A Memoir</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-1">
          <p>
            In 2009, Andre Agassi published <i>Open</i>, an autobiography entailing his journey in becoming one of the greatest tennis players in history.

            <cite="Google Books">He is one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court - but from early childhood
          Andre Agassi hated the game. Coaxed to swing a racket while still in the crib, Agassi resented the constant pressure even as he drove himself to
          become a prodigy, an inner conflict that would define him. Now, in his beautiful, haunting autobiography, Agassi tells the story of a life framed by
          such conflicts.

        <q>
          Honest in a way that such books seldom are. . . . An uncommonly well-written sports memoir. . . . Bracingly devoid of triumphalist homily, Agassi’s is one of the most passionately anti-sports books ever written by a superstar athlete.</q>

        <q>
          Agassi may have just penned one of the best sports autobiographies of all time. Check—it’s one of the better memoirs out there, period. . . . An unvarnished, at times inspiring story [told] in an arresting, muscular style. . . . Agassi’s memoir is just as entrancing as his tennis game.</q>
