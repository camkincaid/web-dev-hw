      <h1> Traditional Italian Carbonara Recipe </h1>
        <!-- Recipe found from AllRecipe's online -->
      <p>Over the past summer, while traveling in Europe, I
      experienced the <strong>best carbonara</strong> dish of my life in Rome,
      Italy. The flavor of the pecorino cheese combined with
      perfectly cooked homemade pasta and pieces of melting
      pancetta were literally mouth blowing. So, coming back to
      America, I was <b>determined</b> to find a recipe online which could
      resemble the classic Italian dish. This recipe is originally from
      <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/245775/spaghetti-alla-carbonara-the-traditional-italian-recipe/" target="_blank">allrecipes</a>.
