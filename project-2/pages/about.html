      <h1><id="about">About Me</h1>

<h2 id="about-author">Who am I...</h2>
<p  id="about-author-bio"> I am a first time website coder and love cooking and traveling. I am currently a senior studying business marketing and I am on the UM tennis team. In my free time I enjoy cooking or watching shows such as Bizzare Foods, Food Network Star and Chopped! Last summer I traveled to Europe for the first time visitng countries such as Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Monaco and France. Obviously the food I ate there was incredible!
<h2 id="about-project">The Project</h2>
<p  id="about-project-experience"> For this project, I chose an instructable on "Spaghetti all Carbonara" a classic Italian dish. The reason I chose this dish was because I swear the carbonara dish I tried in Rome was one of the best plates of food I'd had in my life. <i>No joke.</i> The Italian restaurants in America such as Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill in no way produce the same pasta texture and flavor as the pasta I tasted in Italy. So, I wanted to find a homemade recipe to duplicate my wonderful experience.
<h2 id="about-process">The Process</h2>
<p  id="about-process-learned">I learned so much during my process of creating this website. I had never used HTML before so it was exciting to learn new things, experiment with trial and error and in the end see a super cool result that I created myself!</p>
