# My Second README.md

## The Instructable

* This week I had a lot of fun experimenting and trying to set up the web page of the instructable. I learned how to add color and comments. I also utilized different types of sematic markups
* I find the textbook to be extremely helpful in outlining how to/the use of all the different codes
* At the beginning of the assignment I was having a hard time just starting the web page but figured it out from project-1
* I'm worried that my coding is not organized "properly/politely" and would like some feedback on that. I'm also worried that once coding becomes more complex, it will hard to fix errors/see errors.
* Moving forward, I'm excited for the coding to become more complex and more detailed. I'm looking forward to turning this basic webpage into a real/prettier webpage :)
