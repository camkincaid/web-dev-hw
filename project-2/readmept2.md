# My Second README.md

## The Instructable - HTML Pt. 1

* This week I had a lot of fun experimenting and trying to set up the web page of the instructable. I learned how to add color and comments. I also utilized different types of sematic markups
* I find the textbook to be extremely helpful in outlining how to/the use of all the different codes
* At the beginning of the assignment I was having a hard time just starting the web page but figured it out from project-1
* I'm worried that my coding is not organized "properly/politely" and would like some feedback on that. I'm also worried that once coding becomes more complex, it will hard to fix errors/see errors.
* Moving forward, I'm excited for the coding to become more complex and more detailed. I am looking forward to turning this basic webpage into a real/prettier webpage :)

## Week #2 - HTML Pt. 2
* This week I learned I definitely <i>did not</i> follow exact instructions from did way too much last week (oops!). But it was fun to take the content I created last week such as instructions and incorporate and improve for the "instructions" page
* I was having trouble with atom because it kept crashing anytime I did "html preview". Anyone else have this problem? I finally figured out I would just preview the html in the browser as I was making changes. But the crashing problem still exists so would love to fix that! Help!
* I learned how to center text and images...simply by using < center > < / center >...very handy
* The forms were a bit of a struggle with the different table styles. And YIKES I'm starting to feel a tiny overwhelmed with all of the new tags we are learning (since I want to memorize them)
* I'm still using the textbook which is extremely helpful
* Overall, this part took me a while but with much trial and error I was finally able to figure it out and had a lot of fun while doing it!

## Week #3 - HTML Pt. 3
* This week was about adding media. I had a hard time getting the .mp4 and opened source version to work on my about me page! Embedding a video from Youtube was far easier since it was just a copy and paste.
* Other added contents such as the map/email were pretty straight forward
* One thing I am still unsure about is the purpose and use of the ID attribute
* I went through and "cleaned up" all of my code on each page and made sure the metadata format was similar across all pages
* Update: I fixed the problem of the video as it was source path error!
