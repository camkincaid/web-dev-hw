<h2>By Andre Agassi</h2>
<p> "It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life.
Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements
of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match
is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit
inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days.
Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly
connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way
seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest.
It's our choice.‚Äù
